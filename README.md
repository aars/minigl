# MiniGL

MiniGL is a minimal Game Library, available as a Ruby gem, and built on top of
the [Gosu](http://www.libgosu.org/) gem.

Please note:

  * The test package is not complete! Most of the functionality
provided by the gem is difficult to test automatically, but you can check out
this [working game example](https://github.com/victords/aventura-do-saber).
  * The documentation is under construction.
